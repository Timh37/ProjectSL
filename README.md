## Overview

This code contains two directories, slr and lib. slr contains code for analyzing tide
gauge data and generating sea-level rise projections. lib contains supporting files.

This code requires MATLAB to run. It uses the Optimization and Mapping toolkits, though
some of the functionality should be available without those toolkits.

The code directory does not include some needed input files, which go in the IFILES directory
(specified in configureSLRProjections). These include:

	* the CSIRO GSL reconstruction,
	* the ICE5G-VM290 GIA model (NetCDF),
	* land ice static-equilibrium fingerprints,
	* Marzeion et al. 2012 glacier and ice cap projections,
	* PSMSL tide gauge data.

A 91 MB ZIP file containing these input files is available from the authors. 

## Sea level rise projections

runTrainGPSLModel.m will generate a set of parameter files with optimized hyperparameters
for each of the regions described in the coastlines.txt parameter files. (It is
recommended that you use the default specifications, which are stored in slr/PARAMS; the
training process is slow).

runSLRProjections.m will generate the sea-level rise projections, using the configuration
specified in configureSLRProjections.m and generating the output files specified in
outputSLRProjections.m. You will need the slr/, slr/MFILES, and slr/MFILES/scripts directories
in your path.

You will need to modify the paths in configureSLRProjections.m to match your system.
